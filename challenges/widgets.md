# Challenge: Widgets

Create a basic system description and document a normalized schema from the attached widgets text file. Include

1. what you think this system does
2. what you feel would be a reasonable database structure for the data and a reasonable architecture for the system
3. any questions or concerns you have regarding this dataset/system that might need to be answered before establishing an ideal database/solution for such a system.

It's a very open-ended problem, and that's part of the problem.

## System Description:

The system appears to manage information related to various types of traps, specifically animal traps, and their associated details. This includes information about the type of trap, its packaging, the customer or retailer it is sold to, its price, the supplier or manufacturer, the cost, the warehouse where it is stored, the quantity available, and a minimum quantity requirement.

## Proposed Database Structure:

To create a normalized schema for this system, we can design a relational database with the following tables:

1. Widgets (or Traps) Table:

   - Fields:
     - widget_id (Primary Key),
     - widget_name

2. Packaging Table:

   - Fields:
     - packaging_id (Primary Key),
     - packaging_type

3. Customers Table:

   - Fields:
     - customer_id (Primary Key),
     - customer_name

4. Suppliers Table:

   - Fields:
     - supplier_id (Primary Key),
     - supplier_name

5. Warehouses Table:

   - Fields:
     - warehouse_id (Primary Key),
     - warehouse_location

6. Widgets_Info Table:
   - Fields:
     - widget_info_id (Primary Key),
     - widget_id (Foreign Key),
     - packaging_id (Foreign Key),
     - customer_id (Foreign Key),
     - price,
     - supplier_id (Foreign Key),
     - cost, warehouse_id (Foreign Key),
     - qty,
     - min_qty

### Note:

Foreign keys link the Widgets_Info table to other tables, creating relationships. This allows us to retrieve specific information about widgets, packaging, customers, suppliers, and warehouses associated with each widget.

## System Architecture:

The system can be built using a multi-tier architecture:

### 1. Presentation Layer:

- This layer includes a user interface where users can interact with the system. It could be a web application, a mobile app, or a desktop application.

### 2. Application Layer:

- This layer contains the business logic of the system. It processes user requests, communicates with the database, and performs necessary operations.
- Programming languages like Python, Java, or .NET can be used to develop the application layer.

### 3. Database Layer:

The database layer stores and manages the data. A relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server can be used.
The normalized schema described above will be implemented in the database layer.

## Questions/Concerns:

### 1. Data Integrity:

Ensure data integrity by enforcing constraints and validations, such as checking that the cost is less than the price and that the quantity is not less than the minimum quantity.

### 2. Updates and Inserts:

Consider how frequently new trap records are added and existing records are updated. Optimize the database for efficient INSERT and UPDATE operations.

### 3. Reporting:

Determine if the system needs reporting capabilities, such as sales reports, inventory reports, or supplier performance reports. This will influence the database design.

### 4. Security:

Implement proper security measures to protect sensitive data, especially pricing and supplier information.

### 5. Scalability:

Plan for scalability in case the number of trap types, customers, or suppliers grows significantly over time.

### 6. User Access Control:

Define roles and permissions for users accessing the system to ensure that only authorized individuals can perform certain actions.

### 7. Backup and Recovery:

Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy to prevent data loss in case of system failures.

### 8. Performance:

Consider potential performance bottlenecks and implement indexing and caching strategies to optimize database queries.

### 9. API Integration:

If necessary, plan for integration with external systems or APIs for tasks like order processing or supplier communication.

### 10. User Training:

Train users on how to use the system effectively to minimize errors and improve productivity.

By addressing these questions and concerns, you can design an ideal database and system solution for managing the widgets or traps effectively.
